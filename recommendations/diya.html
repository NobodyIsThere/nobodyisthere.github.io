        <h1>Games for Diya</h1>
        <p>So you&rsquo;re a certified PC GAMER now. As promised, here&rsquo;s a list of personalised recommendations for you.</p>

            <input type="checkbox" id="diya" class="fake" checked><label for="diya">
                <h3>Diya</h3>
                <p>Every game on this list is here because I think you might like it, but this game is one that I think might appeal to your specific interests.</p>
            </label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="acclaimed" class="fake" checked><label for="acclaimed">
                <h3>Acclaimed</h3>
                <p>This game is popular for a reason. And that reason is that it&rsquo;s really good. This is one of those games that you <em>should</em> play, you know?</p>
            </label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="vn" class="fake" checked><label for="vn">
                <h3>Visual Novel</h3>
                <p>This game is a visual novel, or interactive fiction, or just visual-novel-like enough that I decided it should get this tag.</p>

            <img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/253230/library_600x900.jpg" alt="A Hat in Time">
            <p>Do you like Mario? I don&rsquo;t, but I enjoyed playing <cite>A Hat in Time</cite> with James. It&rsquo;s cute and it has a good photo mode.</p>

            <h2>Magicka</h2>
            <img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/42910/library_600x900.jpg" alt="Magicka">
            <p>Freely combine elements to make spells that accidentally kill your friends. Very silly, very fun. Also very hard towards the end, but you can probably pick it up for about 75p so I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s worth it even if you don&rsquo;t finish it.</p>

            <img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/381780/library_600x900.jpg" alt="80 Days">
            <p>Interactive fiction adventure game based on Jules Verne&rsquo;s <cite>Around the World in 80 Days</cite>. Beware the utterly pointless real-time element. I think it might have been added for the PC release, so consider getting the mobile version for the best experience.</p>

            <p>Rhythm dungeon crawler with one of the best soundtracks you&rsquo;ve ever heard. Oh, and Hatsune Miku is in it. She might be DLC, though? Not sure. However much they charge for this game, it isn&rsquo;t enough.</p>

            <p>It claims to be an RPG, but it&rsquo;s more of a visual novel. But it&rsquo;s a musical and it features Greek mythology, so I thought you&rsquo;d be into it. I was slightly disappointed, but maybe my expectations were too high. It&rsquo;s definitely worth a look.</p>

            <p>Yeah, technically it&rsquo;s a puzzle game, and the controls can be a bit tricky, but there is no way I&rsquo;m leaving this one off the list. If you liked <cite>Return of the Obra Dinn</cite>, you&rsquo;ll probably like <cite>Outer Wilds</cite>.</p>

            <p>Telltale&rsquo;s version. Telltale really set up the episodic &ldquo;choices matter&rdquo; genre with this game. It&rsquo;s good!</p>

            <p>V&rsquo;s company made it! V didn&rsquo;t work on it, though. It&rsquo;s an escape room/puzzle box game. So like <cite>Zero Escape</cite> but without the visual novel parts. So like <cite>Zero Escape</cite> but without the good parts. It&rsquo;s good though.</p>
